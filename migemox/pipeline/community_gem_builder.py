Model Builder for MiGEMox Pipeline

This module contains functions dedicated to the construction, modification,
and preparation of microbiome community models. It handles the integration
of individual microbe GEMs, the addition of host-microbiome compartments,
the creation of community biomass reactions, and the pruning of models
based on sample-specific abundances.

    Get the active exchange metabolites in a MATLAB model.

    This function loads the MATLAB model and gets the active exchange reactions in the model.
    It does so using a process that mimicks the process used by MMT.

    The process is as follows:

    1) Load the model from the file
    2) Find the biomass reaction if not provided.
    3) Find all exchange reactions and metabolites.
    4) Apply standard MiGEMox coupling constraints to all reactions in the model.
    5) Run FVA.
    6) Find all exchange reactions with a min or max flux whose absolute value is greater than 
       0.00000001. These are the active exchange reactions.
    7) Convert these exchange reactions to metabolite IDs and return the list of active exchange metabolites.

    Parameters:
        mod_path: The path to the model file to run FVA on.
        biomass_name: If provided, treats the reaction with this ID as the biomass reaction. 
                      The reaction must exist in the model if provided. If this value is not
